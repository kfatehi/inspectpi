dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt

in /boot/overlays/README it says

Name:   pi3-disable-bt
Info:   Disable Pi3 Bluetooth and restore UART0/ttyAMA0 over GPIOs 14 & 15
        N.B. To disable the systemd service that initialises the modem so it
        doesn't use the UART, use 'sudo systemctl disable hciuart'.
Load:   dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt
Params: <None>

so you should run 

sudo systemctl disable hciuart

to connect to a serial console you can use minicom

sudo apt-get install minicom

and then

minicom -D /dev/ttyAMA0
