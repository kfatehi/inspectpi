enable forwarding in kernel with
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
do it permanently in  /etc/sysctl.conf 

# reset the firewall
# flush all rules, delete all chains, and accept all
# accept all traffic
sudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
sudo iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
# flush the nat and mangle tables, flush all chains (-F)
sudo iptables -t nat -F
sudo iptables -t mangle -F
# and delete all non default chains (-X)
sudo iptables -F
sudo iptables -X
# now enable forwarding
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE

sudo sh -c "iptables-save > /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat"

in /etc/network/interfaces add this to autoload it
up iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat


# aight now we need a web interface
# lets get nodejs

curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_7.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs

# lets say i wanna run something in the background via /etc/rc.local quickly
# tmux is useful for doing this when im in dev mode too. e.g.: 
#
# tmux new -d -s my-session 'watch date'
#
# great for running a bunch of things in panes too, e.g.:
# tmux new -d -s my-session 'echo window-1 pane-1; sleep 8' \; \
#           split-window -d 'echo window-1 pane-2; sleep 6' \; down-pane \; \
#             new-window -d 'echo window-2;        sleep 4' \; next-window \; \
#                 attach \;

installed and configured udhcpd on the zero. didn't test yet.
currently looking to create a PPP network adapter that allows the serial connection between 3 and zero
to use IP, this way we should be able to communicate from the dev host to the target host through
the 3 and the zero. the 10.5 to 10.4 jump will the going over the PPP/serial so it will be slow
but the transfers and stuff happening over this line will never be more than a backup or something.
and for those situations an image copy or image mount may be more appropriate anyway.
the usefulness of doing this is pretty much to be able to run scripts on the target, orchestrated
from the inspectpi webinterface in a more reliable way than doing it through the serial line
directly without using PPP. for example here is the naiive approach:

https://gitlab.keyvan.pw/crumple/workbench/blob/master/lib/serial-tty.js

it is clear to see how much extra code had to be written to deal with the error-prone-ness of that approach

in the case of inspectpi, however, we have time to look at better approaches (PPP):
